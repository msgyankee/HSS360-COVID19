		<p>
		A choropleth is a map where various regions are colored according to a data value. 
		In this example, individual counties in a geoJSON map have been tagged with an id so that the choropleth script can associate them with counties in a table of data, and then set their fill color according to their unemployment rate.
		You could, in principle, use this to color any kind of set of objects based on their ids (not just maps). You could also use the choropleth code to do things color than change the fill color -- it is, at its heart, just a way of changing the properties of an SVG object on the basis of its value.
		</p>
		<p>The trickiest thing to keep in mind about a choropleth: the geoJSON map is a description of objects that have their own data (e.g., they are tagged with an id that identifies the county). Your dataset describes how a county might be associated with another piece of data (in this case, unemployment rates). So the setup involves telling the script how your data connects onto the map's data -- the point of connection.
